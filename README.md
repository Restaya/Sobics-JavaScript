This project is based on [this](https://www.games68.com/games.php?id=2183) game, written in Javasrcript using JQuery.

You can move the character sideways with your mouse, use the left mouse button to take and throw blocks.
If the thrown blocks color matches the surrounding block's color, they're removed and you gain points.

Every 3rd throw a new row of blocks is generated with random colors.
At the 15th throw the game ends.

If you throw the block before the time bar is fulled, you gain more points.

To launch the game, open the index.html file, or drag it into your broswer.
