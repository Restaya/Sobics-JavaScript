This project is based on [this](https://www.games68.com/games.php?id=2183) game, written in Javasrcript using JQuery.

You can move the character sideways with your mouse, use the left mouse button to take and throw blocks.
If the thrown blocks color matches the surrounding block's color, they're removed and you gain points.

Every 3rd throw a new row of blocks is generated with random colors.
At the 15th throw the game ends.

Throw the block before the red time bar is full, you gain more points.

To launch the game, download the ZIP file, extract it to a folder, then open the index.html file, or drag it into your broswer.
